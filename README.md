This project is a memory card game that we can play in the browser. 

We have:
  - game board (+ template for game board if we haven't played yet)
  - 12 cards (6 pairs of cards)
  - start game button - when we click on it, we can automatically start new game (even if our game is already going on)
  - modal, which fires up after the end of the game
